            <h2>Sign Language Interpreter</h2>
            <textarea id="textInput" >yesterday i my cousin in she near river her apartment high above street with plus we where enjoy while relax under a bright jacket i my favorite shirt plus hat my afternoon warm never cold wind we a food plus for we school plus a building outside a store
                Walking near the river showed water shining under sun. Birds flew past , another soaring
                above in clear sky. My cousin pointed at a boat floating , starting talk about places—
                Japan perhaps , maybe a small town far away. Resting on grass felt nice , starting
                chatter about everything. She explained her library work , assisting people find stories ,
                learn skills. I told tales about my teacher , strict yet fair , plus friends joking often.
                Relatives came up—loud grandmother , funny uncle , young cousin dancing always. She
                asked about my week , I mentioned a math challenge , nervous yet doing fine. She said
                nice , warming my heart.
                Sunset colored sky orange plus pink , signaling our return. Stopping at a restaurant
                offered meat , fish , soup , yet we picked hot fries shared between us. The waiter smiled
                , bringing food fast. Eating satisfied us , followed by tea sipped while looking out the
                window. A person wearing a red dress walked outside , another riding a bike rang a bell.
                City sounds buzzed—cars honking , people rushing quick. I told her about travel
                hopes—Africa , France , Australia. She agreed , wanting Italy , imagining pasta plus old
                buildings. Laughter followed our wild ideas.
                Her apartment greeted us back , resting on the couch near her animal purring softly.
                Another chewed a toy , dropping the toy , barking loud , making us laugh. Turning on the
                screen showed a story—a strong girl saving her town , music playing loud. Tea sounded
                good , so she brewed some while I grabbed cups from the kitchen. Sweet smells
                lingered from her earlier bread. Drinking tea , we finished watching , discussing our
                parts in that story. She picked fight , I chose run , joking at our differences.
                Time passed late , leaving me tired yet happy , unwilling leaving yet. She suggested
                cards , pulling a set from her shelf. Playing lasted hours , betting snacks , me winning
                three times. She acted mad , smiling still. Looking outside , city lights shone like stars
                against dark sky. A car honked below , an animal barked far. Past memories surfaced—
                losing ourselves at a fair , eating too much food , building a snowman melting next day.
                She mentioned her busy week , assisting a student with work. I shared my challenge
                fears , doing anyway , earning her happy words. We discussed her mom cooking , my
                dad fixing cars.
                She showed a picture—her brother , now a doctor. I revealed a drawing—my sister’s
                animal. Hours slipped by , forcing my leaving. Hugging at the door , she handed me a
                story—space , sun , stars. Thanking her , I promised returning next month. Stepping
                outside , cool wind touched my face , sun glowing above. Walking house echoed with
                shoe sounds on street , mind replaying park , river , food , story—lucky feelings for her
                company.
                House greeted me with my mom cutting fruit in the kitchen. Telling her everything
                brought her smile , asking about fun. Nodding yes , I headed toward my room. Bed
                softened under me , blanket warming fast. Placing the story on my desk near pencil plus
                paper , I darkened the light. Quiet house contrasted my busy thoughts—river hopes plus
                her laughter calming me asleep.
                Morning brought rain tapping my window , keeping me staying in bed , recalling
                yesterday. Rising , I toasted bread , adding sweet , resting with relatives. My brother
                talked about school , my sister questioned the animal. Describing traveling , eating ,
                card games drew their laughter when snack wins came up. My mom expressed park
                interest , prompting my agreement for another travel. Reading her story later showed
                sun pictures , star tales , science words—park sunlight on water flashing in my mind.
                Grabbing a pencil , I wrote yesterday’s moments—bird flying , tea brewing.
                Afternoon cleared rain , pushing me outside . Wet grass plus fresh wind greeted me , an
                animal climbing a tree sparking park thoughts. Planning a talk later , I’d mention the
                story , suggest next month—travel perhaps , maybe a story. Any choice promised fun
                with her. That day stood special—not just park or food , but relative closeness plus
                shared time , holding that picture in my mind , I eagerly await returning near the river.
